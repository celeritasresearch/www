        <p>We want to be the first high school team to win <a href = "https://f1tenth.org">F1TENTH</a>.</p>
        <p>
            Celeritas Research brings together the smartest high school students to work on software and hardware for small RC-style cars to race on unseen tracks,
            to move towards a future where progressing autonomous driving is accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a collective, we do research on everything from efficient artificial intelligence edge computing to the physics of turning a four-wheel vehicle, while producing intermediary shippable work.
            We plan to create in the open and release everything to the public, for free as in freedom. We provide students with guidance, mentorship, and funding to create.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are gearing to launch. Applications are now public; we will begin remote but soon will be working in-person in Fremont, CA.
            Our first task as a group will be conducting research on novel methods for next-action prediction in simulation racing and theoretical experiments with designing a light drivetrain.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are advised by professors and industry experts: Waterloo, Google, Meta, and more.
